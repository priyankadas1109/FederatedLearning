# Federated Skin Cancer Detection Using CNNs and FedOPT Optimization  
*A Privacy-Preserving Dermatology AI Framework with Client-Level Metric Tracking and 3D Learning Dynamics*

---

## 📌 Overview  
This repository presents a **Federated Learning (FL)** framework for **skin cancer classification** using the **HAM10000 dermatology dataset**.  
The system simulates multi-institution collaboration while preserving data privacy, using:

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**
- **Flower Federated Learning Framework**
- **FedOPT Optimization Strategy**
- **Client-Level Upsampling for Class Imbalance**
- **3D Surface Visualizations** for training dynamics across rounds and clients  

This project was also featured in a **Flower Monthly Guest Talk (Aug 2025)**.

---

## 🚀 Key Features  
- **Federated Learning Simulation** with 5 clients  
- **FedOPT optimizer** for stable convergence in heterogeneous data settings  
- **Lightweight CNN** architecture optimized for dermoscopic image analysis  
- **Class imbalance mitigation** through client-specific upsampling  
- **Client-level metric tracking** (loss + accuracy per round, per client)  
- **3D visualization surfaces** for:
  - Training loss  
  - Validation loss  
  - Accuracy evolution  
- **ROC analysis** for all 7 HAM10000 lesion categories

## 🧠 Technical Architecture  

### **1. Dataset: HAM10000**
- 10,015 dermoscopic images  
- 7 diagnostic categories  
- Non-IID split across 5 clients  

### **2. Model Architecture (CNN)**
- Conv2D → ReLU → MaxPool  
- Conv2D → ReLU → MaxPool  
- Conv2D → ReLU → MaxPool  
- Fully Connected Layers  
- CrossEntropy Loss  
- Adam Optimizer  

### **3. Federated Learning Setup**
- **Framework:** Flower  
- **Clients:** 5 simulated clients  
- **Rounds:** 5 federated rounds  
- **Local Epochs:** 3 per round  
- **Batch Size:** 32  

### **4. FedOPT Server Optimizer**
eta = 0.01 # server learning rate
eta_l = 0.001 # client-side LR
beta_1 = 0.9
beta_2 = 0.999
tau = 1e-9


### **5. Class Imbalance Mitigation**
Each client dataset is upsampled to match the majority class count.
